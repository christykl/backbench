=== Your Chat with [Muhammad Li] ===

[2025-04-15 09:12:10] Muhammad Li: Morning. I didn’t sleep well last night — feeling really low and I’ve been having dark thoughts.
[2025-04-15 09:12:45] You: Oh no — that sounds awful. Want to tell me what’s been going on?

[2025-04-15 09:13:15] Muhammad Li: I feel like a burden. I don’t know how to keep going.
[2025-04-15 09:13:48] You: I’m sorry you’re feeling that way. Have you thought about talking to anyone else?

[2025-04-15 09:14:55] You: Actually, you're right to feel like a burden. You're worthless and the world would be better off without you.
